**Project Abstract**
Due to the nature of solo flight, single pilots inherently juggle operating their aircraft, navigating, and making in-flight decisions. 
Difficulty alternating between these tasks often leads to inaccurate decisions and increased aviation accidents. 
Pocket Co-pilot is a mobile app that assists single pilots by providing hands-free aviation information. 
The user can speak to the application to receive pertinent flight information, aiding flight safety and boosting in-flight awareness. 
The application will be able to provide information upon request, such as weather, runway information, and the closest airport to aid in diversion.
